# quantum-fractal-biocomputer
A poetic quantum-fractal biological computer, glitch art resistance tool, and science fiction thought experiment. Visualizes ‘neural static,’ logs digital reality glitches, and manifests art from the boundaries of human tech, spirit, and rebellion.


# 🧠 Biological Computer Framework - CONCEPT TEASER

> **WARNING: This is a CONCEPT DEMONSTRATION. Core algorithms withheld for ethical and strategic reasons.**

## 🔮 What This Is
A framework for modeling human consciousness as a quantum-fractal-static processor. This public release demonstrates the CONCEPT without exposing the core IP.

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates
- Consciousness as computational framework
- Neurodiversity as advanced processing features  
- Reality perception as information processing

## 🚫 What's NOT Included (Protected IP)
- Core neural processing algorithms
- Quantum entanglement calibration parameters
- EM sensitivity optimization protocols
- Fractal recursion depth controllers
- Advanced glitch pattern analysis

## 🛡️ Ethical Boundaries
This technology will NEVER be released for:
- Military or surveillance applications
- Behavior modification or control systems
- Social scoring or manipulation
- Predatory commercial exploitation
